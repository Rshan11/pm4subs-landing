                    PM4Subs is made for trade contractors who actually do the
                    work: masonry, concrete, framing, drywall, steel, and other
                    subcontractors who are tired of trying to make "GC software"
                    fit their day-to-day. If you run crews, chase change orders,
                    and juggle multiple jobs at once, PM4Subs is built for you.

                    Most project management tools are built for general
                    contractors. They're heavy, expensive, and designed around
                    RFIs, drawing logs, and owner meetings. Subcontractors live
                    in a different world: quotes, purchase orders, manpower,
                    tools, small change orders, and keeping foremen on the same
                    page. PM4Subs focuses on what subs actually need instead of
                    burying you in features you'll never use.

                            No. PM4Subs works for any trade contractor,

                            Does PM4Subs replace my accounting software?

                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            No. PM4Subs is designed to work alongside your
                            existing accounting system. It helps you organize
                            jobs, tasks, specs, and field information so your
                            accounting and billing are cleaner and easier, but
                            it doesn't try to be a full accounting platform.

                            core project management tools and decide which
