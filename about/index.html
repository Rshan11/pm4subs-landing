                <h2>Why I Started PM4Subs</h2>
                <p>
                    After years of running masonry crews and juggling RFIs, photos, change orders, and estimates across
                    emails and texts, I realized something: subcontractors don't have simple tools that fit the way we work.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    Everything on the market was too expensive, too slow, or designed by people who have never stepped onto a jobsite.
                    So I started building small tools for my own company - quick header calculators, proposal helpers, and ways to
                    stay organized.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card mb-4">
                <h2>Building Tools That Make Sense</h2>
                <p class="mb-2">PM4Subs exists because subcontractors deserve software that is:</p>
                <ul class="about-list">
                    <li>Simple</li>
                    <li>Affordable</li>
                    <li>Fast</li>
                    <li>Built around field work</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2">No complexity. No enterprise junk. Just tools that get the job done.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>By Subs, For Subs</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything on this platform is built with real-world experience - from header rentals to spec analysis to
                    tool tracking. If it doesn't save time on the job, it doesn't go in the product.
